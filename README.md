## Composite
```
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) that you created in your Software Project Management
Plan (SPMP) is a tree structure and depicts the work to be done and required effort. Each node can be
decomposed further until required effort is understood. Write an application which will print the required
total effort of a software engineering project.
```

## Iterator
```
CTIS has two separate internship applications. CTIS290 and CTIS310. Both of these
applications keep a studentâ€™s name, id, and the company. However, CTIS290 uses an ArrayList, CTIS310
uses Array. CTIS department would like merge these two separate applications

```
A digital audio player application will play either MP3 or MP4 files, and which decoding
algorithm will be set dynamically during run-time.

## Template Method
```
 An image display application displays either TIFF or JPEG files. First it opens the
file and then loads to memory. Depending on the type of file, an image is processed differently, and can be
enhanced. After an image is processed and optionally enhanced, it can be displayed.
```
